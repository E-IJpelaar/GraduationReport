In an attempt to create a model based controller that can be applied to the soft robotic actuator, the developed non-linear model should first be validated. This is done by using a planar 2 degree-of-freedom soft robot. This robot has a translational and rotational degree of freedom. Rotation is only dependent on the difference in bellow length, not absolute bellow length. To measure rotation, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is connected at the tip of the robot. The position of the bellows can be tracked with a camera set-up. From this data, elongation and curvature of each individual bellow can extracted. Being able to measure/determine both degrees-of-freedom allows us to validate the dynamic model.

\subsection{Forward kinematics of the planar robot}

To describe the configuration space of the soft robot, it is regarded as a continuous deformable structure with infinite degrees of freedom.
A model that describes the configuration space of the soft robotic manipulator as a function of space and time was formulated in \cite{Caasenbrood2020}. The model is based on a one-dimensional Cosserat beam together with geometrically exact beam theories proposed in \cite{Simo1986}.

Consider a spatial coordinate $\sigma \in \mathbb{X}$ within the bounded domain $\mathbb{X} \in [0,l] \subset \mathbb{R}$, and a temporal coordinate $t \in  \mathbb{T}$ with $\mathbb{T} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Given these notations, position $p(\sigma,t) \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and rotation matrix $R(\sigma,t) \in \mathbb{SO}(3)$ can be given for any point $\sigma$ and instance $t$ on the continuous backbone of the soft manipulator by,

\begin{equation}
    g(\sigma,t) := \begin{pmatrix}  R(\sigma,t) & p(\sigma,t) \\ 0_3^\top & 1 \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{SE}(3)
    \label{eq2:g}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ is the Lie group of rigid body transformations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ \cite{Sola2018}. Since function $g$ is space and time variant, changes in space and time can be captured by two vector fields in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{se}(3)$. Partial derivatives $\partial (.)/\partial(\sigma)$ and $\partial (.)/\partial(t)$ will be denoted by a `prime' and `dot' for position and time, respectively. The partial derivative with respect to time of (\ref{eq2:g}) results in the time-twist field described by,


\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial g}{\partial t} = \dot{g} = g\hat{\eta} \Longrightarrow \hat{\eta} := g^{-1}\dot{g} = \begin{pmatrix} \Omega_\times & V \\ 0_3^\top & 0 \end{pmatrix} \in  \mathfrak{se}(3)
    \label{eq2:dotg}
\end{equation}

where $\Omega = (\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3)^\top$ and $V = (v_1,v_2,v_3)^\top$ express vectors of angular velocity and linear velocity, respectively. The skew-symmetric matrix $\Omega_\times$ can be related to $\mathfrak{so}(2) \cong \mathbb{R}^3$ given the mapping $\Omega \mapsto \Omega_\times$ \cite{Sola2018}. Here, vector field $\eta(\sigma,t)$ describes an infinitesimal local transformation by a frame at position $\sigma$ between infinitesimally small $t$ and $t+\Delta t$. Following the same logic, the partial derivative of (\ref{eq2:g}) with respect to space results in the space-twist field defined as,


\begin{equation}
   \frac{\partial g}{\partial \sigma} =  g' = g\hat{\xi} \Longrightarrow \hat{\xi} := g^{-1}g' = \begin{pmatrix} K_\times & E \\ 0_3^\top & 0 \end{pmatrix} \in  \mathfrak{se}(3)
    \label{eq2:gaccent}
\end{equation}

in which $K = (k_1,k_2,k_3)^\top$ and $E = (\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2,\epsilon_3)^\top$ represent vectors containing the curvature-torsion strain and stretch-shear strain, respectively. Likewise, vector field $\xi(\sigma,t)$ describes an infinitesimal local transformation by a frame at time instance $t$ between infinitesimally small $\sigma$ and $\sigma+\Delta \sigma$. Because $\mathfrak{se}(3) \cong \mathbb{R}^6$ and with mapping $\eta \mapsto \hat{\eta}$, (\ref{eq2:dotg}) and (\ref{eq2:gaccent}) can be formulated as a column vector in $\mathbb{R}^6$ as


\begin{equation}
    \eta(\sigma,t) = \begin{pmatrix} \Omega \\ V \end{pmatrix}; \hspace{20pt} \xi(\sigma,t) = \begin{pmatrix} K \\ E \end{pmatrix}
    \label{eq2:etaxi}
\end{equation}

For solving the forward kinematics only position of the soft robotic manipulator is of interest, hence the following first order partial differential equation (PDE) needs to be solved for spatial coordinate $\sigma$ only,

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial g}{\partial \sigma} = g \hat{\xi}
    \label{eq2:dgdsigma}
\end{equation}

To solve this PDE, it is transformed to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) which is suitable for controller design. This is done by projecting the infinite-dimensional system onto a subspace of finite dimension which contains basis elements of the expected solution. By reducing the dimensionality of the system, higher order dynamics are not captured in the model, therefore robustness should be taken into account. To transform PDE (\ref{eq2:dgdsigma}), the components of the strain field $\xi := (g^{-1}g')$ are approximated using a finite amount of orthogonal shape functions, as follows

\begin{equation}
    \xi_i(\sigma,t) \cong \sum_{i=1}^N \varphi_i(\sigma)q_i(t) + \xi_{i,0}(\sigma), \hspace{20pt} \forall \sigma \in \mathbb{X}, t \in \mathbb{T}
\end{equation}

in which, $\xi_{i,0}$ corresponds to the undeformed configuration of the robotic manipulator, $\mathbb{X}$ a spatial set, and time set $\mathbb{T} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Additionally, $\{\varphi_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a set of basis shape functions and $q(t)$ are modal coefficients. These modal coefficients can be thought of as generalized coordinates of the finite-dimensional system. The $n$-th order strain expansion can be formulated as

%% maybe write about what shape functions were used

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \xi(\sigma,t) \cong & \hspace{5pt}  (B_a \otimes [ \varphi_1 \dots \varphi_N ])q(t)\\ = &  \underbrace{ \begin{pmatrix}
    \varphi_1(\sigma) & \dots  & \varphi_N(\sigma) & \dots     & 0      & \dots  &  0 \\
    \vdots    & \ddots & \vdots    & \ddots    & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0         & \dots  & 0         & \dots     & \varphi_1(\sigma) & \dots & \varphi_N (\sigma)
    \end{pmatrix}}_{\Phi(\sigma)} \begin{pmatrix} q_1(t) \\ \vdots \\ q_n(t) \end{pmatrix} +  \begin{pmatrix} \xi_{1,0} \\ \vdots \\ \xi_{n,0}   \end{pmatrix}
    \end{aligned}
\label{eq2:xishape}
\end{equation}

where $\Phi : \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a shape function matrix in which $n$ is equal to the amount of modal coordinates, and $m$ the amount of active strains, and $B_a \subseteq \text{span}(\mathbb{I}_6)$ a selection matrix of unconstrained strains. Within matrix $B_a$ the active strains are given a `1' and constrained stains `0'. For the planar soft robot one curvature-torsion strain and one stretch-shear strain are active. 


\todo{cite paper with quaternions}
In Matlab \cite{MATLAB2020} a script was created to calculate the forward kinematics given modal coordinates $q(t)$. To reduce computation time of solving the ODE with \verb+ode45+, $\hat{\xi}$ (\ref{eq2:gaccent}) curvature-torsion strain can be reformulated using quaternion formulation expressing it as a rotation matrix.  $g$ in (\ref{eq2:dgdsigma}) can be reformulated to

\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix} Q \\ r \end{pmatrix}' = \begin{pmatrix} 2 ||Q||^{-1} A(R(Q)K)Q \\ R(Q)r \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $Q$ is a quaternion expressing rotation based on

\begin{equation}
    A(K) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -K_1 & -K_2 & -K_3 \\ K_1 & 0 & -K_3 & \hspace{8pt}K_2 \\ K_2 & \hspace{8pt}K_3 & 0 & -K_1 \\ K_3 & -K_2 & \hspace{8pt}K_1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

    Ad_g = \begin{pmatrix} R & 0 \\ \hat{r}R & R \end{pmatrix}

\eta(\sigma,t) = Ad_{g^{-1}} \int_{0}^{\sigma} Ad_g B_a \Phi(\sigma) d\sigma \dot{q} := J\dot{q}
\end{equation}

\section{Stiffness Determination in FEM}








\subsection{Influence of (non)-linear material parameters}


The influence of linear/non-linear material parameters were investigated by pressurizing both bellows equally for 20kPa and 80kPa for both linear and non-linear material parameters. For the linear case a Young's modulus ($E$) of 69 Mpa and a Poisson ratio ($\nu$) of 0.45 were used. These parameters can be used to calculate the Lamé parameters necessary to simulate non-linear Neo-Hookeon deformation. To this end, Lamé's first parameter or shear modulus $\mu$ and bulk modulus $\kappa$ need to be calculated, these can be calculated with the following equations, respectively

\begin{equation}
    \mu = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    \kappa = \frac{E}{3(1-2\nu)}
\end{equation}

In the Abaqus FEM environment these constants need to be translated to \verb+C10+ and \verb+D1+ parameters by the with

\begin{equation}
    \verb+C10+ = \frac{\mu}{2}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    \verb+D1+ = \frac{2}{\kappa}
\end{equation}

As mentioned, two simulations were carried out pressurizing both bellows equally for 20kPa and 80kPa. Deformations in $x,y,z$ direction for both material parameters are shown in Table (\ref{tab2:linnonlindef}). Node that for this simulation, in which both bellows are pressurized equally, the elongation in $y$-direction is most relevant. The deformation in remaining directions should be small.
