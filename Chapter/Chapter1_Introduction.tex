\section{Background}



\subsection{Introduction to soft robotics}

In recent years the field of soft robotics has gained increasing attention. 

Due to there inherently soft structure, these robots are able to operate safely around humans. 


As they have the potential to revolutionize the field of robotics.

\add{introduce the constant curvature approach here already}





\subsection{Control of soft robots}




\subsection{Dynamic Model}
