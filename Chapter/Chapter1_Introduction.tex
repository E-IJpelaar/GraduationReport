In recent years, the field of soft robotics has received a substantial increase of research interest \cite{iida2011soft},\cite{walker2020soft}, \cite{bao2018soft}. Soft robots cover a vast domain for suitable application. This includes the medical field \cite{sitti2018miniature} \cite{ashuri2020biomedical}, where soft robots have potential applications in artificial muscles, prosthetic devices, stents and surgical instruments. They can also be applied to explore places that are almost impossible to reach for human beings. This includes offshore operation and deep-sea exploration \cite{aracri2021soft}, such as the soft robot exploring the depths of the Mariana trench \cite{laschi2021soft}. Other applications are in the field of industrial automation, where they can support human operators in manipulating objects \cite{george2018control}, \cite{grissom2006design}. A variety of experimental soft robots are displayed in Figure \ref{fig1:softexample}.

The foundation of soft robotic design is often found in nature and includes inspiration for material choice, locomotion, and morphology. As their name already suggests, soft robots are made from soft and flexible materials. Their inherently dexterous structure allows soft robots to easily manoeuvre around obstacles. This makes soft robots robust and very applicable in constantly changing environments. A few examples of bio-inspired soft robots include emulated trunks \cite{hannan2003kinematics} inspired by the proboscis of an elephant, robots based on the arm of octopus \cite{wang2013visual}, and robots that replicate the movement of fish \cite{marchese2014}, Figure \ref{fig1:softexample}. 


\subsection*{Soft robot manipulators vs. traditional manipulators }

This thesis restricts itself to soft robots designed for manipulating objects. These robots reshape the idea of using robots for industrial processes. Currently, rigid robots dominate the field of industrial automation, as they excel in accuracy, repeatability and load capacity. However, these traditional robots tend to be unsafe when operating in human-centred environments. Classic robots are composed of rigid materials and accelerate to high velocities, which could create an unsafe environment for human operators. Additionally, these robots have limited degrees of freedom, making it harder to avoid obstacles. To evade the risk of potential harm, and create more dexterous robots, innovative soft robotic manipulators are designed. Since these robots are composed of soft materials they are inherently safer to operate around humans. However, due to their flexible nature, they show different dynamic behaviour compared to traditional robots. To gain a better understanding of soft robotic manipulators, parallels are drawn and differences are mentioned between soft robot manipulators and traditional robots: i) material, ii) actuation, iii) sensing.


First, a classification is made based on the compliance of their underlying materials \cite{Bionics2008}. Generally, classic robots are made of rigid metal beams, whereas soft robots are made from soft polymer materials. The building materials of the robot largely determine the kinematic redundancy of the robot. Since soft robots are composed of materials with an extremely low Young's modulus, they can sustain large (and possibly non-linear) deformation during normal operation. As a result of this compliance, gravity and payload cause a distributed deformation throughout the entire system. Therefore, these soft robots have a theoretical infinite amount of degrees of freedom. This makes soft robotic control more challenging when compared to traditional robots, as the latter has a fixed amount of degrees of freedom.

Secondly, actuation is a major difference between the two robot types. Whereas traditional robots are generally electro-mechanically actuated, soft robots can be actuated with a wide range of actuation methods, which includes pneumatics, hydraulics, thermal and even chemical \cite{BHA},\cite{marchese2014},\cite{kang2019programmable},\cite{shepherd2013using}. Rigid robots are often linked by rotatory or prismatic joints, where its design allows to include the actuator inside the robot's casting or joint. The actuators of soft robots are often located externally, as their design simply does not allow to integrate them. Most soft robot manipulators are actuated pneumatically or by using variable-length tendons \cite{Rus2015}. A well-known example of a pneumatically actuated soft robot manipulator is the Bionic Handling Assistant (BHA) by Festo, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig1:softexample}). This type of soft robot has inflatable channels that cause deformation when applying pressure. An example of a tendon driven robot is the elephant trunk's robot \cite{cieslak1999elephant} (Figure \ref{fig1:softexample}). This manipulator consists of eight elastic segments linked together by coil springs. Each segment is controlled by two pairs of strings. Servo or linear actuators are used to wind and unwind the strings, with that controlling the movement of the robot. Both actuation methods introduce additional dynamics largely affecting the performance of the entire control system. 

Thirdly, conventional sensing mechanisms can often not be applied to soft robots. For hard robots, the joint design often allows incorporating encoders to measure rotation and other sensory devices. Since the forward kinematics, given rigid joints and links, can be computed through trigonometry, position sensing is relatively easy. For soft robots, the compliant and lightweight nature often prevents the integration of conventional sensors, such as encoders, strain gauges and inertial measurement units (IMU's) \cite{Rus2015}, \cite{Lee2017}. Alternative sensory techniques are often needed. These methods include for instance optical sensors and stretch sensors based on macrobend fibres \cite{Sareh2015}.

\subsection*{Control strategies}

The aforementioned discussed the contrast between rigid robots and soft robots. It showed that soft robot manipulators distinct themselves from traditional robots on three fronts. Their inherent soft body results in a theoretical infinite degree-of-freedom system. The actuation of soft robots introduces additional dynamics caused by the actuators. Furthermore, the conventional sensory mechanisms can often not be applied to soft robots, and therefore demand more complex sensory devices. These factors combined majorly affect the control of soft robots. Recent literature often tries to convey readily available control theories adopted on traditional robots and apply those to soft robotics.

The work of Thuruthel et al. (2018) \cite{george2018control} presents an overview of recent findings in soft robotic control for pneumatically actuated and tendon-driven soft robots. In the mentioned work, three control approaches are distinguished, namely model-free, hybrid and model-based control. A model-free control strategy does not use a kinematic or dynamic description in its control approach. Instead, it exploits learning-based algorithms to dynamically control the robotic system. Hybrid controllers combine learning or empirical elements with a model-based approach. The model-based controllers rely on an analytical description of the robotic system. Furthermore, for each control approach, a sub-division between kinematic and dynamic control is made. Kinematic control is defined as a zero-order input-output relation. This implies that a change in input is directly observed in output. Therefore, this approach is lower-level compared to dynamic control. For the latter, the configuration space and/or task space variables' velocities are used in the control algorithm. 


Research conducted on the Bionic Handling Assistant, as shown in Figure \ref{fig1:softexample}, demonstrates that multiple control methods can be applied to the same robot. A model-free control approach was implemented in \cite{rolf2013efficient}. The inverse kinematics of the robot were obtained through machine learning, instead of model-derivation. Later work shows the implementation of a hybrid controller \cite{reinhart2017hybrid}. In this approach, an inverse kinematic model was used together with a learning model. Previous to this hybrid controller, a model-based controller was proposed by \cite{mahl2014bhakin}. However, this model-based controller only used a kinematic description of the soft robot. This research was followed up by \cite{falkenhahn2016dynamic}, which developed a dynamic controller. In this latter work, the system is controlled with a non-linear length controller based on feedback linearization. This controller was further supported by linear PD and feedforward control. 

In \cite{wang2013visual} visual servo control is used to control a cable-driven soft robotic manipulator. The manipulator, inspired by an octopus' tentacle, is shaped like a cone. On the outer surface of the soft robot four cables are uniformly distributed. Each end of these cables is connected to the tip of the manipulator. The other end of the cables is connected to pulleys. By winding and unwinding the cables on the pulleys, the end-effector can be positioned in the task-space. A kinematic-based servo controller is designed, based on linear PD feedback control with gravity compensation. Position sensing is done by a camera mounted at the tip of the robot, and a fixed feature point. Based on this visual information, a Jacobian matrix is estimated, which is used in the kinematic controller.

In \cite{zhang2017visual} also visual servo control was implemented to control a tendon-driven soft robotic manipulator. Again, kinematic control is used for a reference tracking problem. In the mentioned work, the Jacobian is calculated by a FEM model operating in parallel. The reference input is feed through the FEM model, outputting the Jacobian matrix and expected end-effector position. The Jacobian is used in the controller to control the actual manipulator. The FEM model's expected end-effector position and actual end-effector position are used in a second controller to enhance the Jacobian estimation of the FEM model.

A model-based controller that uses a dynamic model in its control loop is presented in \cite{della2020model}. The robots infinite dimensionality is resolved by regarding the robot being composed of six individual actuatable segments. A piece-wise constant curvature (PCC) approach was used to describe the kinematics of the robotic actuator. For each segment, Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters are used to describe the rigid robot equivalent, which is then used to derive a dynamic model. Essentially, the proposed controller is a computed-torque controller with an additional PD controller. 

\subsection*{Modelling of soft robots}

In the aforementioned work, \cite{della2020model}, the infinite degree-of-freedom soft robotic system is approximated by assuming that the system consists of a fixed amount of segments. This enables the derivation of a model and simplifies controller design. Of course, the reduction of degrees of freedom is at the cost of model accuracy. In the work of \cite{della2020model}, the PCC modelling approach was applied. This is a widely adopted method for describing the configuration of soft robots \cite{ccapproach}. This modelling approach can be applied to soft robots that undergo a very specific deformation. Previous research that used this model include \cite{mahl2014bhakin},\cite{ccapproach},\cite{berkers},\cite{Falkenhahn2015},\cite{runge2017framework}. A schematic drawing of the constant curvature modelling approach is shown in Figure \ref{fig2:ccapproach}. Although our modelling approach distinguishes itself from this methodology, it is important to grasp the basics. 


\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width = 0.45\textwidth]{Figures/Chapter1/ccapproach2.png}
    \caption{Schematic drawing of the constant curvature model, adapted from \cite{ccapproach}.}
    \label{fig2:ccapproach}
\end{figure}


The constant curvature describes the position of the actuator by three coordinates. Parameter $l$ is the curved length of the actuator measured from the fixed bottom to the tip. Coordinate $\kappa$ expresses the curvature of the actuator. It is assumed that the deformed actuator describes a perfect arc, hence radius $r$ is equal to $\frac{l}{\kappa}$. This allows writing the orientation of the actuator's tip as $\theta = l\kappa$. Lastly, parameter $\phi$ describes the rotation of the actuator relative to the ground. A single constant curvature is not able to describe complex actuator configurations. To this end, multiple of these curves are stacked onto each other, thereby discretizing the actuator. This allows describing more complex configurations. This methodology is used in for instance \cite{Falkenhahn2015}.




The PCC approach has some limitations, due to its piece-wise character the actuator configuration is not described by a single continuous function. This makes it harder to find analytical expressions e.g. derivatives. Additionally, this PCC approach only allows assigning material properties to particular points. This makes dynamic models generally less accurate. A method to overcome this problem is using partial differential equations (PDE's) to describe actuator configurations. These PDE's are more suitable for deriving continuum dynamic models. One of these models is the Cosserat beam model which will be exploited in this work. This Cosserat model describes the soft robot's configuration by a continuous curve. This continuous curve reflects strains in the backbone of the (deformed) soft robot. Approximation of these strains allows describing the system in a reduced-order form. The reduction of dimension enables dynamic model derivation for the soft robot. This dynamic model can then be utilized for model-based control purposes.

\section*{Thesis outline and contribution}

In this work, the modelling and control of a single-link planar soft robot are studied as shown in Figure \ref{fig:test2}. This soft robot has a theoretically infinite amount of degrees of freedom, as it is composed of flexible polymer. Furthermore, it is pneumatically actuated, inducing additional dynamics into the control system, and is a major limiting factor on achievable control bandwidth. The soft robot consists of two individually inflatable bellows, allowing the robot to extend and bend. Each of the bellows can be inflated using air pumps. The induced rotation can be measured with an inertial measurement unit (IMU), which is mounted at the tip of the actuator. Using optical tracking, the end-effector position of the manipulator can be determined using an LED marker that is connected to the tip of the robot. The air pumps and sensory devices can be utilized to design a closed-loop controller to perform set-point regulation. A schematic layout of the actuator setup is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:test1}.

This work is a continuation of the research of \cite{berkers}, which detailed a length and curvature controller for this planar soft robot. The mentioned work uses standard PD and PID control methods to ultimately perform a reference tracking problem. The obtained results are moderate for length and orientation control. However, the tracking performance is poor. To enhance the tracking performance of the system a model-based controller is proposed. The fundamentals of this research are provided in \cite{Caasenbrood2020}, which details a framework for modelling soft robot dynamics. Such a dynamic model is valuable for soft robotic control. Given the system description and previous research conducted on the planar soft robot, the research question that we try to answer is:

\textit{Can we develop, simulate and experimentally implement a model-based controller for a pneumatic, single-link soft robotic manipulator to perform a tracking problem?}

To effectively answer the research question several topics need to be considered. These topics are shown in the control layout of Figure \ref{fig1:controlarchitecture}. This control setup also shows the structure of this thesis. In Chapter \ref{chap2}, a forward kinematic description of the soft robot is derived. This allows studying the manipulator's configuration in 2D space. Furthermore, it allows us to study the velocity of the actuator as a function of kinematic configuration. The latter allows us to derive a dynamic model of the soft robot. Also, an air pump model is presented, which allows describing the entire system dynamics. Once this model is derived, a parameter study is performed in Chapter \ref{chap3}. Here, finite element analysis (FEA) is used to capture the non-linear stiffness of the soft robot. Furthermore, experiments are presented which allow determining the air pump dynamics. In Chapter \ref{chap4a}, the design of the model-based controller is detailed. This controller will be tested in simulation, using the dynamic model as derived in Chapter \ref{chap2}. These simulation results, together with experimental results are presented in Chapter \ref{chap4b}.
