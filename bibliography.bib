,    abstract = { Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robotâ€™s Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics. }

@article{Falkenhahn2015,
abstract = {In the previous decade, multiple useful approaches for kinematic models of continuum manipulators were successfully developed. However, dynamic modeling approaches needed for fast simulations and the development of model-based controller design are not powerful enough yet-especially for spatial manipulators with multiple sections. Therefore, a practicable lumped mass model similar to common dynamic models of rigid-link manipulators is needed, which can be used for simulations and model-based control design. The model incorporates mechanical interconnections of parallel and serially connected bellows and uses constant curvature kinematics and its analytical derivatives to balance forces and energies in a global reference frame. The parameters of the resulting model are identified with measurements before the simulation results are experimentally validated. The obtained dynamic model can be used to both simulate the manipulator dynamics and calculate the inverse dynamics needed for model-based controller design or path planning.},
