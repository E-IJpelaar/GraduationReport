This week I have worked the forward and inverse kinematics in report form.
Additionally, I have fixed the Abaqus simulation of which the outcomes are presented in chapter 3. I have carried out simulations for linear and non-linear material properties, performed a mesh refinement to deterimine mininam mesh-size/nodes. Lastly, I have performed simulations for multiple pressures and made a plot with the elongation. I have fitted a polynomial to capture the strain of the robot in y-direction for a first approximation.
