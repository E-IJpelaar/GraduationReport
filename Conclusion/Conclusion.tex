\section{Conclusion}

In this thesis, model-based feedback control applied to a soft robotic manipulator has been investigated. The performance of the control strategy is analyzed utilizing a simulation model and experiments. This developed simulation model incorporates both the dynamics of the soft robot and pressure dynamics. The experimental setup enabled analyzing the controller performance for real-time set-point regulation and reference tracking. This study focuses on a two-bellow soft robot actuated by air pressure. Previous work \cite{berkers} conducted on the same soft robot limited itself to linear control. In that sense, this work approached the control problem with a changed perspective. 


First, a kinematic description of the soft robot is derived based on the Cosserat beam theory. This resulted in a set of partial differential equations describing the robot configuration space. Employing a Galerkin reduction allowed to express the forward kinematics by an ordinary differential equation. The velocity kinematics were used to construct the systems space-variant Jacobian matrix. Based on Euler-Lagrange equations a non-linear dynamic model for the soft robot was derived. To capture the overall dynamics the pump dynamics as first-order systems. Combining the models resulted in an overall description of the system dynamics. 

A parameter study was conducted to obtain the stiffness properties of the soft robot. A FEM model of the soft robot was utilized to study pressure and force-induced deformation. These results were used to extract the non-linear elongation and curvature stiffness. A first-order pressure model was derived analyzing the system's response to a sinusoidal volt input signal. Damping properties could not be experimentally acquired. Under the assumption that accelerations and velocities are low, these damping properties were chosen.

Then a control architecture for controlling the system was designed. This architecture comprised a model-based feedback controller inspired by the soft robots space-variant Jacobian matrix. This Jacobian controller determines the pressure reference to reach a given set-point in the xy-plane. The model-based controller is accompanied by a PI controller to regulate the pressures. 

The control architecture was verified in simulation and experimentally. The derived dynamic model was used to tune the Jacobian controller and pressure. To this end, the response to a step input was considered. This resulted in settling times of 16 seconds in both x and y-direction. Then the tracking of an ellipsoid reference path was studied in simulation. The simulation showed desirable tracking characteristics, with RMS errors of $0.1489 mm$ and $0.0899 mm$ in x and y-direction, respectively. The controller has also been implemented on the experimental setup. Additional filters were needed to improve sensor readings. Again, a step response was used to tune the system. The observed settling times were 12 and 8 seconds x and y-direction, respectively. The best RMS errors for these step responses in x and y-direction were $0.26034mm$ and $0.2644mm$, respectively. The tracking performance was evaluated using the same reference path. During tracking the achieved RMS errors were $0.7926 mm$ and $0.4044 mm$ in x and y-direction, respectively. 

Conclusively, the achieved results in set-point regulation and reference tracking are satisfying. The obtained results during tracking have shown significant improvement with respect to \cite{berkers}. The derived dynamic model has shortcomings with respect to describing the soft robot dynamics. However, it has shown useful in controller design.

\section{Recommendation}

Several recommendations can be given to improve results. The following section lists improvements on the topics: modelling, setup and control design.

Firstly, improvements can be made concerning modelling. In this work, the derived dynamic model is based on a first-order Galerkin reduction, essentially reducing the model to the constant curvature approach. Although, constant curvature is a fairly accurate description of the soft robot's kinematics. The versatile Cosserat beam model can be exploited such that higher-order dynamics can also be incorporated. A higher-order reduction yields an improved representation of the theoretical infinite degree soft robotic system. Furthermore, it would allow studying items such as under-actuation and higher-order dynamics. Regarding this study, the mass approximation can be further improved. Although the stiffnesses seemed to be well captured, the low mass and inertia approximation led to incorrect high eigenfrequencies. Additional model improvements could be the inclusion of Coriolis effects and gravitation effects. Coriolis effects become increasingly important when the system is tuned to perform faster reference trajectories. Gravity effects are relatively simple to include in the model, and give a completer view of the actual forces acting on the system. The last model concern focuses on pressure modelling. A first-order model represents the inflation of the soft robot well. However, deflation of the actuator was neglected. Model-wise this can also be included by a first-order model. 

In terms of setup, several improvements can be made. First of all the system can not be actively deflated. Therefore deflation rates are an important limitation when it comes to high-speed reference changes. The setup could be adapted such that a valve could be added. Also, the choice can be made by introducing pumps that can create a vacuum, to quickly deflate the soft robot. When it comes to air pumps a major improvement can also be the introduction of pressurized vessels. Contrary to diaphragm pumps, pressurized vessels allow for a constant inflow of air. Therefore it would remove the valve dynamics entirely. Furthermore, it would allow for quicker inflation which can improve performance. Additionally, air pumps saturation limits do not need to be taken into account anymore. Other improvements can be made for data acquisition. A major limitation is the sampling frequency due to serial communication between the Raspberry PI and Arduino. Desirably, all control actions and sensor readings would be done by the Raspberry. This would increase the sampling frequency and would allow for real-time evaluate the results. The current vision system has a 60 Hz update rate, which is a considerable limitation when
demanding higher performance. In this study, a low-pass filter was used to give a better position estimate. However, this does add additional delays in the system. Therefore a higher update rate and higher resolution can be beneficial. A final improvement on the setup is the LED marker, in this study a yellow LED was used. However, the hue value is close to the soft robot's hue. Therefore, vision system tuning was cumbersome. It would be better to replace this LED with another coloured LED e.g. red. 


Lastly, there is a lot of performance to be gained with improving the control architecture. In this study, only a feedback controller was considered. In soft robotics, feedback control conflicts with the intrinsic properties of soft robotics. Feedback control namely introduces stiffness, whilst the soft robot is designed to be flexible. To reduce this and enhance performance feedforward can be introduced. In the current control architecture, the pressure reference increases slowly as a result of the integrator action. Since stiffness models are available, the addition of stiffness compensation in the Jacobian controller will ensure a faster increase of pressure set point. Together with a feedforward model on the pumps, this will allow for faster reference tracking. Another improvement would be the inclusion of gravity compensation. Of course, control methods that involve a more model-based approach can be implemented. Promising methods, especially for under-actuated systems, include computed-torque control, (partial) feedback linearization and passivity-based control.
