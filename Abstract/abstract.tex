This thesis details a control method to perform setpoint regulation for a soft robotic actuator. The proposed method combines classic control theory with additional control methods to fit the purpose of controlling soft robots. This introductory chapter provides context in which this research is performed. First, a detailed description of soft robots is provided. Illustrations of already developed soft robots are included. Furthermore, parallels and differences are drawn between soft robots and classic rigid robots. This helps to understand the need for new control methodologies for solving control problems applied to soft robots. This chapter is concluded by detailing the research outline and its research objectives.
