\textcolor{blue}{In this work, a one-link soft robot manipulator is studied. Recent advancements have led to a novel technique of modelling these types of continuous soft robots by exploiting partial differential equations. This method allows describing the manipulator configuration by employing a continuous curve. The theoretical infinite degree-of-freedom soft robotic system is reduced to a finite-dimensional model by exploiting the Galerkin reduction method. This allows the application of well-established theories, including Lie group theory, to derive a dynamic model. In this study, Jacobian transposed control is implemented on the soft robotic system. The performance of this feedback controller is evaluated in simulation and by experiments conducted on a physical setup. To assess the error attenuation, the system is subjected to a step input and a reference tracking problem. The obtained results show favourable error tracking characteristics.}
