In this work, a one-link soft robot manipulator is studied. Recent advancements have led to a novel technique of modelling these types of continuous soft robots by exploiting partial differential equations. This method allows describing the manipulator's configuration by employing a continuous curve. The theoretical infinite degree-of-freedom soft robotic system is reduced to a finite-dimensional model by exploiting the Galerkin reduction method. Paired with a description of the continuous dynamics expressed through Lie group theory, a compact dynamic model is developed. In this study, Jacobian transposed control is implemented on the soft robotic system. The performance of this feedback controller is evaluated in simulation and by experiments conducted on a physical setup. To assess the error attenuation, the system is subjected to a step input and a reference tracking problem. The obtained results show favourable error tracking characteristics.
