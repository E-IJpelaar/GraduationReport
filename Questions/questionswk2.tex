The code has been altered. Unfortunately it doesn't work for NMODE = 1 again. What has exactly changed to the code, so I can solve this problem quicker? \\



Do you know what program can be used for making free body diagrams such as fig 3.1 (Has thesis) pag. 20 and fig 3.6 pag.24\\


I was thinking of using another way of validating the model. I was trying to use a laser distance sensor and measure elongation. However, this means that we can measure 2 dof, rotation and elongation, separately. As there is no way of measuring both dof simultaneously using the laser distance sensor. This did not seem possible now, therefore I want to conduct the experiment with
